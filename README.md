Recently working on this:
I am ujwal a student doing graduation form india . i am also looking to make a website for typing learning , and i want to make this project and do startup on this idea . (idea - making a typing learning platform where there will be 100 exercises that u have to in 100 days (1 exercise each day for about 30min- 1hr) and on day 101 your typing speed will be more than 50-100wpm . for making this work i have made a master formula consisting of drills , tests ,etc and i am working on to find the best ideal path so that anyone can learn typing easily without facing the hardness in the start where you feel like you cant do it .
The startup part is - there are very less who know touch typing in my class and also college , 80% of the people in cs , it , computer branch dosent know touch typing and have less than 30wpm which makes it hard for them to be efficient and speed when working on computers . and i think touch typing is a very basic and easy skill that anyone can have . but people dont know where to learn from and how to learn it . there is no path provided for them to learn -thats what i wanna solve - where you in the industry or in college or school you can learn touch typing and here is a ideal path , u just have to put 1/2hr a day and do exercises daily and you also have this amazing skill. i want to market this idea in colleges and if this thing becomes big then i will think to make a friendly software (typing , programming , web dev-html,css,js) for school students with collabortion with the school and the teaching department , since these are also important skills that a kid need to learn , this skills are being taught in america , and other country but not in india .
please share your thoughts on this with me .
Thankyou .
